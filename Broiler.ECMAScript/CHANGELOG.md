# Changelog — the shared JavaScript libraries

Every release of the `Broiler.ECMAScript.*` packages has an entry here, newest first. The packages
follow semantic versioning under [convention 16](docs/conventions.md):

- a public API removal or a binary-breaking change is a major version;
- a new API is a minor version;
- a correction toward the specification is a minor version, with its own entry under
  **Observable changes**;
- a data-version change is a minor version, with its own entry under **Data**.

Each entry has the headings **Added**, **Changed**, **Observable changes** and **Data**, and says
"none" under a heading with nothing to report. A release without an entry here is not published.

## Unreleased

Packed as `0.1.0-preview.2`: the owner kept the stream's `0.1.0` prefix while it is a preview, though a
new API is a minor version. *(Corrected 2026-10-14; read "Packed as `0.2.0-preview.1`: a new API is a
minor version.")*

### Added

- `Broiler.ECMAScript.Algorithms`: the numerics area, namespace `Broiler.ECMAScript.Numbers`
  (milestone SJL-4.3; adapter guide
  [`docs/adapter-guide-numerics.md`](Broiler.ECMAScript.Algorithms/docs/adapter-guide-numerics.md)):
  - `IntegerConversions`: `ToInt32`, `ToUint32`, `ToInt16`, `ToUint16`, `ToInt8`, `ToUint8`,
    `ToUint8Clamp`, `ToIntegerOrInfinity`, `ToLength`, `TryToIndex`, `ToBigInt64` and `ToBigUint64`;
  - `Float16`: `Encode` under a `Float16NanPolicy`, `Decode` and `Round` (`Math.f16round`);
  - `MathKernels`: `Round`, `Power` (`Number::exponentiate`), `Hypot`, `Cbrt`, `Expm1` and `Log1p`,
    each with its precision stated; and `PreciseSum`, the accumulator of `Math.sumPrecise`;
  - `ExactRounding`, public from this version: the rounding modes (`RoundingMode`,
    `UnsignedRoundingMode`), their option names, negation and application, the increment roundings,
    and `ToDouble`, a ratio of integers rounded once to the nearest Number;
  - the BigInt kernel: `BigIntMath`, every `BigInt::` operation, `asIntN`, `asUintN` and the
    conversions to and comparison with a Number, under a `BigIntPolicy` and charged in Broiler.VM's
    units; and `BigIntText`, `BigInt::toString` at every radix and `StringToBigInt`.

  Every numerics vector of corpus revision 8 that the library answers passes at library level.
  fdlibm 5.3 (SunPro notice) is ported for `Expm1` and `Log1p`, and the BigInt kernel is ported from
  Broiler.VM's `JsBigInt`; see `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.

### Changed

- `BigIntPolicy.RepresentationLimit` is 2^31 - 128 bits, no longer 2^31 - 1 (2026-10-13, milestone
  SJL-4.5, after the pack Broiler.VM's committed feed held as `0.2.0-preview.1` until it was re-pinned
to the published `0.1.0-preview.2`) *(corrected 2026-10-14; read "after the `0.2.0-preview.1` pack that
Broiler.VM's committed feed holds")*. A .NET
  `BigInteger` holds at most 2^31 - 64 bits and throws `OverflowException` past them, so under
  `BigIntPolicy.Unbounded` an operation whose result was between the two widths threw instead of
  answering `LimitExceeded`: `1n << 2147483600n`, `(-1n) << 2147483646n` and
  `BigInt.asUintN(2147483600, -1n)` among them. An operation computes at most four bits past its
  policy before it refuses, so the new limit leaves 64 bits of room. Broiler.JS found it at its
  cut-over, which passes `Unbounded`; a policy of 2^20 bits, Broiler.VM's, never came near it.

### Observable changes

None: the area is new in this stream. What each engine observes at its cut-over is listed in that
engine's own records.

### Data

None.

## 0.1.0-preview.1 — published to nuget.org

*(Heading corrected 2026-10-13, at milestone SJL-4.3, when the next version's entry was opened; read
"Unreleased". This entry was published as `0.1.0-preview.1` by `Publish shared libraries`.)*

### Added

- `Broiler.ECMAScript.Algorithms`: the contract types of the conventions, `WorkCharge`,
  `ResultStatus`, `Failure`, `LengthLimit` and `DepthLimit`.
- `Broiler.ECMAScript.Algorithms`: the number-conversion area, namespace
  `Broiler.ECMAScript.Numbers` (milestone SJL-3.3; adapter guide
  [`docs/adapter-guide-numbers.md`](Broiler.ECMAScript.Algorithms/docs/adapter-guide-numbers.md)):
  - `NumberText`: `Number::toString` at radix 10 (`ToString`, `TryFormat`) and at every radix from 2
    to 36 (`ToRadixString`), and the digits of `toFixed`, `toExponential` and `toPrecision`;
  - `NumberParsing`: `StringToNumber`, `ParseFloat` and `ParseInt`, correctly rounded at every
    radix, and the `StrWhiteSpaceChar` set (`IsStrWhiteSpaceChar`, `TrimStrWhiteSpace`);
  - `NumericLiterals.Evaluate`: the value of a numeric literal in every form, BigInt literals under
    the caller's width limit, and every refusal as a `Failure` with a message identifier;
  - `NumericKeys`: `TryParseArrayIndex` and `IsCanonicalNumericString`.

  Every number vector of corpus revision 4 passes at library level. Ryu (Apache-2.0) is ported for
  the shortest radix-10 digits; see `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.

### Changed

None.

### Observable changes

None: the area is new in this stream. What each engine observes at its cut-over is listed in that
engine's own records (Broiler.JS's changelog; Broiler.VM's JSC entries).

### Data

- Unicode 17.0.0 (`NumberParsing.UnicodeVersion`): the `Space_Separator` members of the
  `StrWhiteSpaceChar` set, generated from the pinned `PropList.txt` by
  `scripts/conformance/generate_white_space_table.py` (convention 13, revised 2026-10-12).

## 0.0.1-probe.1 — not published

The probe pre-release of milestone SJL-2.13: `Broiler.ECMAScript.Algorithms` holding the contract
types listed above under Unreleased. It is packed for Broiler.VM's admission probe and reaches
Broiler.VM through that repository's committed feed. **It is never pushed to nuget.org**: no
Broiler.VM release depends on it, and its version is below every version this stream will publish.
